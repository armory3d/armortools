Brute Pathtracer is a custom built path-tracing engine used in armorcore which trades correctness for speed. It is powered by hardware accelerated ray-tracing and runs on Direct3D12, Vulkan and Metal.

In ArmorPaint, it is used for rendering the path-traced viewport mode and for ray-traced baking features.

By default, the path-tracer supports 64 unique objects and up to 1024 instances. It has two modes - fast, which has most of the features disabled, and quality, which has features like translucency and emission enabled.
